segment_tree.py

A manual array-partitioning and associative query acceleration structure designed to implement
a Segment Tree class directly from fundamental indexing primitives without relying on external
geometric or visual rendering hierarchies.

This module provides a standalone, modular class executing discrete range aggregation operations.
It establishes a balanced binary tree topology inside a linear 1D list structure, handles
isolated node-merging mechanics, and coordinates recursive divide-and-conquer processing
pipelines to optimize arbitrary subset lookups and mutable value injections.

Design Note:
    This implementation prioritizes architectural transparency and explicit algorithmic mapping.
    It leverages in-memory explicit partitioning bounds and 0-based array index manipulation,
    optimizing for isolated educational modeling and algorithmic auditing over native C-optimized
    interval-tree structures.
