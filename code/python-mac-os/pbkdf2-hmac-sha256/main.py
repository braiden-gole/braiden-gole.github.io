main.py

The primary execution entry point and verification sandbox for the custom
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic suite.

This script coordinates a live execution demonstration of the underlying from-scratch
cryptographic engine. It takes a simulated user credential and unique salt configuration,
passes them through the manual hashing pipeline, and prints the resulting high-entropy
derived key as a hex-encoded string.

Usage:
    python main.py

    This function simulates a standard key stretching scenario:
    1. Defines a low-entropy user secret (passphrase).
    2. Defines a unique cryptographic salt value to protect against rainbow table attacks.
    3. Configures an iteration work factor (computational complexity loop count).
    4. Requests a specific target output length for the resulting key block.
    5. Dispatches these parameters to the manual execution stack and reports the results.
