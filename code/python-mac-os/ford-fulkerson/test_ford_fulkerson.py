"""
test_ford_fulkerson.py

Automated unit test suite for verifying the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm (Edmonds-Karp)
across diverse capacity flow network topologies, structural boundaries, and constraints.

Overview:
    This module uses Python's built-in `unittest` framework to execute a matrix
    of 20 unique testing scenarios against the `ford_fulkerson` network flow engine.
    It ensures that residual tracking updates accurately, shortest paths are preferred
    via Breadth-First Search (BFS), and that bottleneck capacities balance precisely.

Testing Scope & Architectural Coverage:
    - Standard Classic Layouts: Validates standard multi-node textbook networks with
      known maximum flow benchmarks.
    - Minimal Inputs & Boundaries: Assesses single-edge profiles, explicit zero-capacity
      configurations, and graphs containing internal self-loops.
    - Connectivity Obstacles: Verifies proper termination and zero-flow return states
      for fully disconnected networks, missing links, or backward-pointing edges.
    - Structural Path Variations: Evaluates flow distribution across symmetric diamonds,
      multi-stage bridge paths, cyclic back-loops, and extreme capacity differentials.
    - Flow Constraints: Targets networks restricted by extreme bottlenecking at different
      points—specifically at the initial source outflow or terminal sink inflow.

Execution Instructions:
    Run the complete testing matrix natively from the shell or command line via:

        python -m unittest test_ford_fulkerson.py
