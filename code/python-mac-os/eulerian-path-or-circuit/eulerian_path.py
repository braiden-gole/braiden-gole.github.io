"""
eulerian_path.py

An implementation of Hierholzer's Algorithm for identifying Eulerian Paths and
Circuits within a directed graph network.

This module provides structural workflows to analyze node degree distributions,
validate Eulerian properties, and reconstruct the exact edge-traversal sequence.
The process is executed in linear time $O(V + E)$ by tracing sub-cycles and
interlocking them via a stack-based depth-first approach, ensuring every
edge is consumed exactly once.

Design Note:
    This implementation is optimized for algorithmic clarity and structural reference.
    Graph definitions utilize an adjacency list map tracking explicit destinations,
    while destructive edge-popping ensures distinct trails are resolved without
    re-evaluating exhausted transitions.
