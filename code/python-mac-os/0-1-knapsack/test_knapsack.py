test_knapsack.py

Automated unit test suite for verifying the 0/1 Knapsack optimization algorithm
across diverse capacity profiles, item asset distributions, and edge-case boundaries.

Overview:
    This module uses Python's built-in `unittest` framework to execute a matrix
    of 20 unique testing scenarios against the `get_maximum_value` engine.
    It ensures that bottom-up dynamic programming states compute correctly,
    capacity thresholds restrict choices accurately, and items are cleanly
    included or excluded according to the 0/1 rule.

Testing Scope & Architectural Coverage:
    - Standard Optimization Layouts: Validates classic textbook item arrays with
      known maximum reward benchmarks.
    - Minimal Inputs & Zero Boundaries: Assesses empty structures, absolute zero
      capacities, and free items.
    - Capacity Obstacles: Verifies proper state behavior when items cannot fit
      due to extreme costs or fractional margin mismatches.
    - Distribution Profiles: Evaluates uniform profiles, highly dominant items,
      redundant identical duplicates, and vast value-to-cost ratios.
    - Scale & Edge Constraints: Targets processing limits with massive resource
      over-provisions or exact fit scenarios.

Execution Instructions:
    Run the complete testing matrix natively from the shell or command line via:
