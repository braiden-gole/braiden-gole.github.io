// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// File: main.go
//
// Description:
//
//	This file provides a simple executable demonstration of the AVL tree
//	implementation. It exercises all public-facing operations exposed by
//	the avltree package, including tree creation, insertion, searching,
//	and deletion.
//
//	The demonstration uses a deterministic set of keys chosen to trigger
//	AVL rotations and rebalancing internally, allowing correctness of
//	both structural and logical behavior to be observed via output.
//
//	This file is intended for validation, debugging, and instructional
//	purposes, and does not expose or rely on any internal implementation
//	details of the AVL tree.
//
// Notes:
//   - Output is purely informational and reflects logical operations only.
//   - Structural rebalancing occurs internally and is not directly visible.
//   - This program is suitable for use as a reference example or test driver.
